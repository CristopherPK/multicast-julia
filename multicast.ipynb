Por quê?\n\n**Resposta**: _Não, pois ao tornar o B_multicast síncrono, a cada chamada tivemos que aguardar sua resposta, então a saída ficou ordenada de acordo com as chamadas dos processos. No caso do B_multicast assíncrono observamos que não há uma ordem na saída dos processos, aquele que for encerrando suas atividades primeiro vai imprimindo a saída. _\n\n\n\n### Exercício 2: Análise de desempenho do B-multicast (2,0 pontos)\n\nMeça o tempo de execução duas versões do B-multicast (síncrona e assíncrona). Dica: utilize a macro `@time`.\n\n* Execute 50 vezes essa medição e construa um gráfico em forma de barras:\n\t* cada barra representando cada versão do B-multicast;\n\t* calcule e coloque no gráfico o [intervalo de confiança](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) com nível de 95%.\n    \n**Gráfico**: <img src=\"images/B-multicast.png\">\n    \n    \n* Qual das duas versões teve o menor tempo de execução? Por quê?\n\n**Resposta**: _A versão síncrona, por ser de simples execução, em um pequeno número de repetições, o algoritmo síncrono apresenta melhor desempenho. \nO algoritmo assíncrono necessita se comunicar por flags, avisando quando o resultado está disponível, tornando mais lento neste caso. Apesar de apresentar o melhor resultado \nneste teste, o B-multicast síncrono não é escalável, pois a quantidade de processos envolvidos afetaram o desempenho diretamente._\n\n\n\n### Exercício 3: Análise de desempenho do R-multicast (3,0 pontos)\n\nImplemente duas versões do algoritmo R-multicast: uma assíncrona e outra síncrona.\n\n* R-multicast síncrono"

Por quê?\n\n**Resposta**: _O R-multicast assíncrono apresenta um melhor resultado. Diferente do B-multicast, onde há apenas o envio da mensagem sem nenhuma checagem, \nno R-multicast nós checamos a integridade da mensagem, e verificamos se todos os processos já receberam. Caso um processo já tenha recebido a mensagem, \nnão há necessidade de repetição, não como o B-multicast, onde independente se o processo recebeu ou não a mensagem, ele irá realizar a chamada de procedimento remoto novamente.  \nAssim, percebemos que o R-multicast assíncrono terá um tempo menor de execução pois não precisa aguardar um outro processo finalizar a checagem para retornar o resultado._\n\n\n\n### Exercício 4: Análise de desempenho: B-multicast vs. R-multicast (3,0 pontos)\n\nPara cada uma das comparações abaixo, qual dos algoritmos teve o menor tempo de execução? Por quê?\n\n* B-multicast assíncrono vs. R-multicast assíncrono.\n    \n\n**Resposta**: _O R-multicast assíncrono apresenta menor tempo de execução. Apesar de apresentar checagem de mensagem, o R-multicast não irá retransmitir caso o processo já tenha recebido a mensagem, diferente do B-multicast, assim tornando mais eficiente._    \n    \n* B-multicast síncrono vs. R-multicast síncrono.\n\n\n**Resposta**: _O R-multicast síncrono possui menor tempo de execução. Por razões semelhantes ao que já foi discutido anteriormente, checagem de mensagem e retransmissão._\n\n## Entrega\n\nAs respostas deverão ser entregues nos devidos campos desse arquivo, ou seja, em [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) e no formato [IJulia Notebook](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl).\n\nO programa deve ser implementado na linguagem de programação **Julia**. Seu trabalho será testado na [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.org), portanto teste seu arquivo IJulia na JulizBox antes de enviá-lo.\n\n\n### Forma \n\nO arquivo IJulia Notebook deverá ser entregue ao Professor **exclusivamente por e-mail** para o seguinte endereço: **prof.alage** (no) **gmail com**\n\n\nSerá registrada como data de recebimento do trabalho a data indicada pelo servidor de e-mail do Professor. \n\nA responsabilidade sobre a integridade do arquivo contendo trabalho é exclusivamente dos discentes. Serão ignorados os trabalhos cujos arquivos não conseguirem ser abertos ou se o e-mail não chegar à caixa de entrada de e-mail do Professor.\n\n### Prazos\n\nO prazo de entrega sem atraso é o dia **12/10/16**.\n\nTrabalhos entregues com atraso serão aceitos, no máximo, até o o dia **16/10/16**. Serão descontados 5% da nota obtida por dia de atraso.\n\n\n## Pontuação extra\n\nO(a) discente que realizar mais tarefas, além do que foi especificado neste trabalho, o professor atribuirá de 0,5 a 1,0 ponto extra a depender da relevância da contribuição no programa. O critério será decidido pelo professor. \n\nO(a) discente deve indicar qual é a tarefa executada. Por exemplo, adição de funcionalidades, armazenamento de dados em arquivo, documentação de código, comentários em inglês sem erros ortográficos, etc.\n\n\n**Plágio** A nota zero será atribuída caso haja qualquer tipo de cópia parcial ou integral assim como as devidas medidas legais.
